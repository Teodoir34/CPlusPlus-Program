# CPlusPlus-Program

The two projects I choseto share were the final project which involved creating code to control a thermostat wirelessly and light up an LED indicating the heating was on when this was the case and the project with the initial LED controls. I chose these two because the LED control and indicator lesson was valuable in laying the groundwork for my final. I think I particularly enjoyed the little bits of customization I was able to incorporate for fun and to make the project feel my own in both. I really struggle with creating things that feel cold and fit into a tiny box - funny coming from a software engineering concentration however I feel that ethically it is important to instill a little bit of humanity in what I create and move forward in the world withan understanding that what I build should always help people or acomplish something witha strong moral code in mind. 

I believe I can improve HEAVILY on better designing prior to jumping into a project. I didn't have a lot of time this term with so much going on between classes, work, and unforeseen life events however I know I can do a better job outlining my projects instead of just jumping in and rushing to complete and then spending forever trying to debug them. With this course I have added a greater understanding of embedded systems and how periphereal devices can be incredibly useful to how I approach problem solving in the world. I've always wanted to take a Raspberry Pi and make a smart mirror and have been beyond nervous to do so but now I think I have the knowledge to really do something great with this new understanding! 

In terms of readability for the project I think using appropriate spacing, comments where applicable, and using understandable constructors/variable naming was really what let me go back and understand what I did and in the future will be how I can make sure my code is sustainable and long-term. 

Overall I really enjoyed this course and as graduation approaches I feel more and more prepared to take on the world and create something great!
